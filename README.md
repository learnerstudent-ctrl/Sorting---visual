# 🧠 Sorting Visualizer using C++ and SDL2

This project is a real-time **Sorting Visualizer** built in **C++** using the **SDL2** library. It visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work using animated, color-coded bars that change dynamically as sorting progresses.

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🎲 Random array generation on pressing `0`
- 📊 Visualize multiple sorting algorithms with keys:
  - `1` – Selection Sort
  - `2` – Insertion Sort
  - `3` – Bubble Sort
  - `4` – Merge Sort
  - `5` – Quick Sort
  - `6` – Heap Sort
- 🎨 Colors indicate comparisons and swaps
- 🔁 Dynamic updates at each step
- ❌ Quit anytime using `q`

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C++
- SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
- g++ Compiler

---

## 🧪 How to Run

1. **Install SDL2** on your system (Linux/Mac/Windows).
2. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o sortVisualizer -lSDL2
   ./sortVisualizer
